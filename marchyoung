What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
-> Are we finally getting GIL-less threads in cRuby?
-> Do we have to use JRuby to avoid the GIL?
-> Is there a way to get native threads like in C/C++/Java?
-> Are there threadpools and other thread related stuff like in C++ Boost (hopefully easier to use)?
 
What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
-> Wish we had native threads as fast as Java?
