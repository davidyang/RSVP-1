What would I like to learn about Ruby concurrency?
I know next to nothing about concurrency in Ruby, but do understand it in other languages (mostly Java, a bit in Python). I'd like to learn about what makes programming with concurrency particularly challenging in Ruby.

What do I wish Ruby did better for concurrency?
See above. Need to understand it first.
