What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
I would like to learn how to get the most out of ruby concurrency either using MRI with GVL or possibly an alternative ruby implementation like Jruby.

What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
I wish ruby MRI did not have a GVL allowing for true concurrent processing.
