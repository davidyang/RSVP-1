### What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
* I would like to learn concurrency best practices in Ruby.
* I would like to have a better understanding of the limitations imposed by the GIL, and the challenges involved in removing it.
* The differences between MRI and other implentations like Rubinius and jruby.

### What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
My wish is that as the future brings more and more cores to our machines, that we are still able to use Ruby to program them, while taking full advantage of those cores.
