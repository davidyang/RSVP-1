# What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?

Anything! In a previous life I wrote a lot of Producer-Consumer queues in Java, but in Ruby I am either working on Rails
or in small shell scripts, so I don't explictly deal with threads at all. I imagine there are a lot of obscure gotchas
having to do with Ruby's object model.

# What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?

I don't know what it does poorly!
